This is a racing game in the sense that two players compete to be
the first to complete a task. The game involves two players, each
moving seven stones (black or white) from their start position to the
end of the board, and then back off the board. Once all of one
player's stones are off the end of the board, that player wins.
The game rules are here:

1. There are two players, each who have seven stones, off the
board.
2. First the white player moves, then black, and alternate that way
until the game is over.
3. During a player's turn, you will roll 4 tetrahedral dice. The dice
have two of the corners with a white dot, the other two
without. Therefore there is a 50% chance for each die to come
up with the dot. This leads to a binomial distribution for the
dice roll values.

    a. The number of dots facing up on the die will be the
    number of spaces that one can move a piece.
    
    b. When a piece is ready to enter the board, it can be moved
    onto the board at the starting location for a price of one
    movement dot (and then continue moving that piece).
    
    c. You may also move a piece already on the board the
    number of spaces as dots that are pointing up on the die.
    d. You cannot move a piece when it would end up on top of
    one of your own pieces.
    
    e. You can move a piece if it will land on an opponent's
    piece, unless that player is on a rosette.
    
    f. If you land on an opposing piece (they are not on a
    rosette), then you knock their piece off the board and they
    have to start again.
    
4. Rosettes are special spaces which do two things:
a. If a player lands on a rosette, that player gets to roll again.
b. If a player lands on a rosette and their stone remains
there, it cannot be knocked off the board (back to start).
5. If a player cannot move because their pieces are all blocked, or
they get a zero total on their dice, they don't move and their
turn ends.
6. In order to go off the board, you must roll exactly 1 more than
the number required to get to the last space. If you are at the
last space you must roll a 1 to leave the board.
a. If you are two places from the end, for instance, and roll a
4, then that move is not possible.
b. If you are two places from the end and roll a 3, then you
can move off the board.
7. The game ends when all 7 of one player's pieces have traveled
the path.
